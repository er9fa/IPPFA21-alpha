  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I'm a second year Systems Engineering major from Richmond, VA with an
      interest in data science/finance. At UVA, I'm involved in the Data Science
      and Analytics club, WUVA News (videography and journalism), and Theta Tau.
      My hobbies include Bollywood dance, basketball, and hiking. I also enjoy
      traveling and creating videos wherever I go. Lastly, I also have a
      beagador (beagle + labrador) named Coco who I love to spend time with! I am
      very excited to work with everyone this semester!
